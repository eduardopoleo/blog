  <p>Lasty, I am really passionate for what I do. I keep a ‘hand made’ and up to date blog where I offer insights about my ideas and different programming technologies. I also religiously join the ruby hack-nights to collaborate and provide original solutions to coding challenges. If you want to know more about me or my work please make sure to check my resume , github profile and my portfolio site. I hope to hear back from you soon.</p>
