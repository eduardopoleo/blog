    <p> I am chemical engineer who codes and I have been programming in ruby/rails for the past year. During this time I have been developing applications with increasing difficulty ranging from a simple <a class ="score-link" href="http://www.epoleo.me/articles" target="_blank">blog</a>, all the way to fully test driven <a class ="score-link" href="http://firecamp.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">information system</a> with non-trivial services integration such as Stripe, Sidekiq, and Amazon S3.  </p>

  <p> The next logical step in this progression is to join a kickass team of developers from which I can learn how to maintain and enhance high traffic applications. I have no doubt the Score is the place I want to be because: </p>

  <ul>
    <li> Your app rocks and I use it all the time to follow  my favorite “La Liga” and “NBA” teams.  </li>
    <li> You have great developers that are constantly solving <a class = "score-link" href="http://techblog.thescore.com/analyzing-s3-and-cloudfront-access-logs-with-redshift/" target="_blank">challenging problems</a> while giving back to the community.  </li>
    <li>You understand the importance of <a class = 'score-link' href="http://techblog.thescore.com/2014/10/22/succeeding-as-a-developer" target="_blank">camaraderie and communication</a> for the growth of developers.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I understand that you can only welcome top quality talent to your team. I firmly believe that with my recent efforts and current tool set I am off to a good start:</p>
