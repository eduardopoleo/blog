        <h1 class="Hello">Hello, world!</h1>
        <p>I am a tech-enthusiast that find very rewarding to create applications other people can see, use, share and modify.  

        <p>I started programming by creating Matlab applications that performed rather complex numerical calculations. Currently, I have expanded my programming skills to include other scripting languages and frameworks, such as Ruby, Python and  Rails.</p>

        <p>At the moment I am playing around with Ruby on Rails and Bootstrap but I am an email away to contribute to cool new projects! Be sure to check my <i class="fa fa-pencil"></i> blog to know what I am up to these days.</p>

          <p class="activity-description"> I took interest in science early in highschool and I currently hold a M.Sc in Engineering. I really enjoy well narrated nature documentaries and "pop" science books (e.g QED, History of the Universe, among others.)</p>

          <p class="activity-description"> I will start a self-paced (but awesome) Javascript course very soon and probably will be joining a brand new Linux course on the edX platform. On top of that I have a couple of small web projects planned for the near future. </p>
